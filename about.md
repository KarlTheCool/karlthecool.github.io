Hey.

You're at the place for all things Karl. Karl Phillips.

I like learning about games, design, and art. More than that, 
I like sharing my findings with friends and family. I figured the way to
take it to the next level was to also share it online. I might post about
stuff I made, learned, or other projects I find interesting. As long as
it involves making the world a little less annoying.
