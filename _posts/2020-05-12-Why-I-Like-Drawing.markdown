It's pretty straight forward. I got started because I wanted to make cool pictures. The hobby never really took off until I started learning about fine arts techniques through [Proko](https://www.youtube.com/user/ProkoTV). Suddenly a very gimmicky and intuition-based skill became one a lot more precise and strategic. Long story short, regardless of art style, you can look at every line and shade of color as conveying shade and form of a figure. When you think this way the practice becomes more akin to programming than anything. Breaking your problem down into the many little steps you need to get to the end. It's great fun.
