For the longest time, my desk was located in the kitchen. It started with my parents wanting to monitor what I was doing on the computer, and
just extended through highschool as a way to make sure the house didn't seem empty. I could never get work done in this area. I wasn't sure why,
but the fingers just weren't moving and the Reddit browsing was plenty. As such, through highschool I tried a couple types of persciptions for
ADHD to help me get work done. All in the hope that once I hit college work would be interesting enough I wouldn't need it. Besides, the drugs
weren't really an easy mode for me. When I don't want to do work, popping a pill isn't exactly easier than picking up a pencil.

This lead me in a search for a new way to remain focused.

The first thing I realised was I could do a massive work grind in the library. It wasn't exactly quiet, but that was alright. No one was
bothering me so it was distraction free. This worked for assignments that needed an hour or two, but it had a huge momentum killer in
having to pack up when I innevatably had to go to the bathroom. After all, who doesn't enjoy starting a work binge with a cup of coffee.
Clearly this wasn't the final solution.

When I landed my first job, the results were as suspected. I had all the benefits of the library, but without needed to pack up after
an hour. It was an open-concept place where I shared a large desk with 4 people. Not exactly an office, but pretty much what I came to
be used to working in the library. This was a game-changer in my experience. Suddenly I was introduced to the joy of getting lost in
projects for days rather than blasting assignments in hours. I didn't need a tightly constrained packet, but I could persue large goals
without losing focus. It was hugely fun to see myself become the mega nerd who I had only seen in others up to this point.

As time when on, I realised the company wasn't for me. Nothing shocking, but I had finished a project I was assigned and in the process
had noticed a load of spurs that made me uncomfurtable. Finding myself at home, I knew what I could achive in an office, I just needed
to figure out what exactly that meant to build one at home.

Location is important. Some people insist on work / play area being seperate. So far I haven't found this neccisary but your results may
very. For me it was enough just to have a quiet area from all the TV's playing, calls being answered, and food being burnt.

Another big deal in picking a work area was privacy. In more specific, having some kind of barrier between you and people who might interact
with you on a whim. It doesn't feel like much, but all this small questions and chores are a big deal in breaking momentum. Which when tapping
into hyperfocus is pretty much the only way to get work done, momentum is everything.

A small thing I'll note is cleaning up your online environment too. A big change I made as adding distracting content to my ad blocker. Stuff
like Youtube recommendations or trending topics on Stack Overflow. Anything built to keep your "engagement" up should definitely be removed in
your work station.

Overall, there's a lot of advice out there on taming the tiger internally to keep your focus going. When it comes to a dedicated workspaces, it's
not about teaching the tiger to ignore the pigs, but to give him a forest where rabits are the only thing to hunt.
