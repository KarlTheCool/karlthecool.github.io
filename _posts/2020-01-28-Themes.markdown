Watching the latest [CGP Grey video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) got me inspired to rethink how I tackle my goals. Long story short,
for your general hobbies and passions in life that can't be quantified, you want to have a message to live by that will slowly steer you into the
direction of it. For example, if you want to get fit, start down a road of noticing whenever you make a decision, and redirect that decision to be
towards your theme. This greatly reduces the anxiety of failing arbitrary goals and is overall a relaxed way to tackle things you don't fully understand
yet. At first I tried out the idea of a yearly theme. The theme of "finiality". Turning as many open-ended projects I had into finished ones. So far things have been great, and I've found yet another way to reduce work anxiety, and I feel myself making more progress every day.
