Hearing [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoy014xOu7ICwgLWHd9BzQ) talk about it, time tracking seemed incredibly intimidating at first. 
Having hoards of data about myself to lead where I improve was incredibly appealing but the thought of tackling ADHD with it seemed impossible.
If I could remember to track when I switch from editor to Hacker News to Reddit, wouldn't I just not do those things in the first place? Besides, 
it seems *stressful*. I already stress too much about not working enough, which stresses me out, which pushes me to immediately "satisfying" actions
(ie. burning hours on Reddit and still feeling like crap), which perpetuates the cycle. I can't handle policing myself and an excel spreadsheet isn't
going to change that.

Turns out that time tracking was not only easy but more beneficial and satisfying than I first thought.

## Giving your life more focus

The desire to focus turned out to be making me do the opposite. Constantly stressing about whether I was working or relaxing, then stressing about
how I should be doing the other was an endless cycle of doing neither. So when I started time tracking, I suddenly noticed something before I had
even clocked out. I was more focused on the work I was doing. The only thing I had done was my current use of time was to read a textbook and
that what was being clocked. Turns out just taking the small task to decide the current theme to the situation was enough to get me going. More
surprisingly, deciding I was *not* going to work made it much easier and more time-efficient to relax. All that worrying about whether my relaxing time was deserved, just resulted in me building more stress, that extended how long I needed to relax. Committing to not doing work, in turn,
took my 5 hours Youtube binges into around an hour.

## Catching yourself in the act

Having a timer with a label isn't a lot to maintain, but it is all that's needed to know when you're distracted. By marking down that work time was
work time, it made it possible to realize when I was or wasn't supposed to have my eyes glued to a Youtube video. Handily enough, since I can already
see how long I've been watching a video, it made it easy to retroactively time track how long I had been distracted.

## Having the data to feel accomplished

The least strategic part of my time tracking wasn't the data as I initially thought. But that didn't change the fact I felt damn good about looking back
on a week and see how my balance has been.

# Tips to get started yourself

* **Track your themes, not your tasks**: Make a list of your hobbies and types of work. Tracking Hacker News vs Reddit is too time-intensive.
* **Broaden your tasks until you feel comfortable enough to start**: The biggest fear of getting started is feeling hounded or micro-managed.
Broaden the specificity of the tracked tasks to alleviate this feeling so you can get started.
* **Count up and not down**: No one likes an alarm or arbitrary rules. Don't negatively re-enforce yourself with jarring noises after an hour
of Youtube, but instead, relax in knowing that you've had a solid relaxation for 59 minutes and 43 seconds and its time to get back to work.
* **Keep your timer visible**: Time flies, use that to your advantage while working to positively re-enforce yourself seeing a zero into a
twenty and into a whole forty-five minutes.

That's about it. Turns out time tracking isn't just for nerds, but it's for everyone.
