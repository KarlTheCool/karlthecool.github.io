Me and my Boyfriend participated in the [Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019) this year. I thought it would be fun and a good excuse to get familiar with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
The theme was "only one". We had a couple of ideas but ended up going with a top-down shooter where everyone has only one magazine. Both you and the enemy are working together to load a gun to shooter each other.
I think the game turned out well. The depth is a little shallow being only a weekend jam, but I accomplished my goal of trying to teach the player without a full tutorial and creating a decent "aha!" moment. I encourage
everyone to [play the full game in browser](https://karlthecool.itch.io/last-bullet-make-it-count) or if you're curious about Godot, you can [download the source code](https://github.com/KarlTheCool/gmtk2019-funny-bullets) and open it in the engine. Have fun!
