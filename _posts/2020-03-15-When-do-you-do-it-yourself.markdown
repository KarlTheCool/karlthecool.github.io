I've always liked the idea of going electric. With all the exposer about saving the environment, it seemed like the best and coolest way to
contribute. I always dreamed of getting an electric bike. Once I had one, I couldn't get over the concern of it being stolen when left outside.
So I then bought a Onewheel I could carry in with me. My city opened up tremendously, as the 5000km+ odometer proves, but then soon started
closing in again as I had to always rigorously plan my days out, or be forced to carry the 30lbs weight for ages indoors. 
Buying an electric skateboard seemed like the obvious compromise to sacrifice some ride comfort for more than half the weight of the wheel.
But tucked away inside the decision there was a temptation. A secret salesman promising more than I ever desired.

It doesn't matter what you get into, the gang is known as "DIY" is always there. Talking about how inadequate your next enthusiast purchase is.
The performance you're missing out on and overall quality. All for what? The price of not just doing it yourself. You'd be crazy to skip it.
So why not just jump right in.

Of course, DIY is never as advertised. At least if you go in with the same force people are trying to pull you with. You end up in an endless
rabbit hole of better, cheaper, and then better, constantly weighing the odds only to buy a mishmash of parts that you need weeks to figure out all
the kinks of. So from now on, how do I recommend jumping into DIY?

Accept your first build is going to suck in some way. I tried to see if adding months on months of research could help this, but not really.
Go cheap. There will always be someone who chimes in saying their board blew up the first day or a battery was dead on arrival, but if the
the cheap option has existed for years, then there's plenty of happy customers who aren't speaking up being the reason for that.

Steps are never done, they're only good enough for now and that's ok. This is the holy mantra of doing it yourself.

Start with the small number of manufacturers you can. The fewer manufacturers you purchase from, the higher the compatibility you'll experience.

Use your excitement for the end to push you to learn more, but don't look at it longingly like it's impossible. It'll be pretty much your only
source of positive re-enforcement while trying to learn.

Have fun. Learn something new. Do more engineering than you thought as a computer science major. You never know what you're gonna get.
